#TYPE CASTING NOTES

#typecasting is the process of converting one data type to antoher. 
#python has two types of conversions; implicit and explicit

#implict data type is performed automatically by python's complier.
#example of this is converting an into to float if it picks up the inserted value with a decimal

#explicit data type conversion uses provided python functions.
# str()
# int()
# float()
